 # About me 
Hi, my name is Zishan. i'm passionate with web devolopment. this is where i'm starting to think responsivelly. 

i might upgrade this project a little more but i'm done for today. 

## what have i learn through this project. 
1. mainlly some basic to a little advance flex-box. 
like: **flex-basis, flex-grow, flex-shrink**

### flex-basis
The flex-basis property is a sub-property of the Flexible Box Layout module. **It specifies the initial size of the flex item, before any available space is distributed according to the flex factors.** *When omitted from the flex shorthand, its specified value is the length zero.*

### flex-grow
The flex-grow property is a sub-property of the Flexible Box Layout module. **It defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary.** It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. *It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.*

### flex-shrink
The flex-shrink CSS property *sets the flex shrink factor of a flex item.* **If the size of all flex items is larger than the flex container, items shrink to fit according to flex-shrink.**

2. different value in css. like: **em**, **rem**, **vh**, **vw**, **%** unit, and also use **px**.

### em : => Emphasis element/The em is simply the font size.
In an element with a 2in font, 1em thus means 2in.

**for padding and margin. (i also learn how they calculated)**

### rem : => The root element's font-size
**for font size.**

### vh : => viewport height
**VH is useful for creating full height elements (100%) that fill up the entire viewport's height.** Of course, you can use any percentage of the viewport's height to achieve other goals, such as 50% for half the height, etc. % is similar to VW and VH but it is not a length that is relative to viewport's width or height.

### vw : => viewport width
VW is useful for **creating full width elements (100%) that fill up the entire viewport's width.**

mostly usefull for **setting font-size**

### % : => % is %. 
idk, how to explain. 

3. @media, and (min-width & max-width)

4. and some new design concepts.
